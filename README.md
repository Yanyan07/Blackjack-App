Go to the folder frontend in terminal, and run "npm i" and "npm start". In your browser, the home page is displayed. Click "start" button to start the game and click "exit" button to end the game anytime. Click "deal" button, you'll receive 2 cards. Picture cards are worth 10 points and Aces are worth either 1 or 10. "Hit" for another card, and get your score as close to 21 as you can without going bust. "Stand" for no more card, and show the result. It shuffles every 5 rounds of game, and restarts game when it runs out of cards in the deck.

## Lessons Learned
In this project, I learned how to let events happen in a certain order in different ways, and how to use different pieces of partial images to make up a whole card picture in CSS. And I would do more functions for the project, like the wager function.
