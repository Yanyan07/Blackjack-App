# Blackjack App 

## Overview
* The Blackjack Game project is a web application that allows users to play the popular casino card game, Blackjack. The application utilizes the Spring Boot framework for the backend and React for the frontend.

* Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a card game where the objective is to be dealt cards with a higher total value than the dealer, without exceeding a count of 21. In this game, the dealer uses two decks of 104 cards, and the values are assigned as follows: Aces count as either 1 or 11, and face cards (King, Queen, and Jack) count as 10.

* Whether you are new to Blackjack or an experienced player, this application provides an opportunity to learn and enjoy the game. You can play this classic casino game just for fun and improve your skills along the way. With practice, you'll become a skilled player and start winning in no time.

## Lessons Learned
* In this project, I learned how to let events happen in a certain order in different ways, and how to use different pieces of partial images to make up a whole card picture in CSS. And I would do more functions for the project, like the wager function.
